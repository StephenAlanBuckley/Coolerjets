The basic idea is to make cross-site flagging extension which allows users to
block or flag accounts on various sites, and to indicate to users which accounts
other users have flagged frequency.

In order to make this, we'll need 3 parts:
1) an extension which finds usernames for (certain) site and can inject css
2) a databse which stores information about which user reported which accounts on which sites
3) a python API to handle requests from the extension to the DB
